Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably its worth noting the nuances between the two Machine learning deep learning and neural networks are all subfields of artificial intelligence However deep learning is actually sub-field of machine learning and neural networks is subfield of deep learning The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process eliminating some of the manual human intervention required and enabling the use of larger data sets You can think of deep learning as scalable machine learning as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture Classical or non deep machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs usually requiring more structured data to learn Deep machine learning can leverage labeled datasets also known as supervised learning to infrm its algorithm but it doesnt necessarily require labeled dataset It can ingest unstructured data in its raw form eg text images and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another Unlike machine learning it doesnt require human intervention to process data allowing us to scale machine learning in more interesting ways Deep learning and neural networks are primarily credited with accelerating progress in area such as computer vision natural language processing and speech recognition Neural networks or artificial neural networks ANNs are comprised of node layers containing an input layer one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node or artificial neuron connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value that node is activated sending data to the next layer of the network Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network The deep in deep learning is just referring to the depth of layers in neural network neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the inputs and the output—can be considered deep learning algorithm or deep neural network neural network that only has two or three layers is just basic neural network
